# Hi there, I'm Kimaya Raut! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate backend developer with a solid foundation in computer engineering and a year of practical experience in building scalable and efficient applications. I enjoy working in dynamic environments where creativity and technical expertise intersect to solve complex problems.

## ðŸ’» What I Do
I specialize in backend development, utilizing technologies like Python, Flask, FastAPI, and MongoDB to craft robust and high-performance solutions. Hereâ€™s a glimpse of what Iâ€™ve worked on:
- **AI-Powered Applications**: Contributed to RDX at Ease My AI Pvt Ltd, implementing real-time detection systems and optimizing memory management on diverse platforms.
- **Web Applications**: Developed several tools, including mental health and personality prediction systems, crop forecasting applications, and paraphrasing tools, focusing on integrating machine learning models and enhancing user experience.

## ðŸš€ Current Projects
- **[Mental Health and Personality Prediction](link-to-repo)**: A web app using Flask and machine learning to predict mental health status and personality traits based on user input.
- **[Crop Forecasting Tool](link-to-repo)**: An application utilizing a RandomForestClassifier to recommend optimal crops based on soil and environmental data.
- **[Paraphrasing Tool](link-to-repo)**: A tool designed to refine text by correcting spelling and grammar errors for improved readability.
- **[Online Lecture Scheduling](link-to-repo)**: A system developed with FastAPI and MongoDB for managing course schedules and instructor assignments, ensuring no scheduling conflicts.

## ðŸŒ± What Iâ€™m Learning
I am continuously exploring new technologies and best practices to stay at the forefront of backend development and machine learning. Currently, I'm diving into [specific technology or area of interest, e.g., cloud computing, containerization with Docker].
