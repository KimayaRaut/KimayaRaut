Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate backend developer with a solid foundation in computer engineering and a year of practical experience in building scalable and efficient applications. I enjoy working in dynamic environments where creativity and technical expertise intersect to solve complex problems.

## 💻 What I Do
I specialize in backend development, utilizing technologies like Python, Flask, FastAPI, and MongoDB to craft robust and high-performance solutions. Here’s a glimpse of what I’ve worked on:
- **AI-Powered Applications**: Contributed to RDX at Ease My AI Pvt Ltd, an advanced application leveraging AI for real-time detections using user-owned cameras. 
- **Web Applications**: Developed several tools, including mental health and personality prediction systems, crop forecasting applications, and paraphrasing tools, focusing on integrating machine learning models and enhancing user experience.

## 🚀 Current Projects
- **[Mental Health and Personality Prediction](https://github.com/KimayaRaut/Mental-Health-and-Personality-Determination-using-Machine-Learning-)**: A web app using Flask and machine learning to predict mental health status and personality traits based on user input.
- **[Crop Forecasting Tool](https://github.com/KimayaRaut/Crop-Forecasting-Using-Machine-Learning-Random-Forest-Classifier)**: An application utilizing a RandomForestClassifier to recommend optimal crops based on soil and environmental data.
- **[Paraphrasing Tool](https://github.com/KimayaRaut/Paraphrasing-Tool)**: A tool designed to refine text by correcting spelling and grammar errors for improved readability.
- **[Online Lecture Scheduling](https://github.com/KimayaRaut/Online-Lecture-Scheduling-Module)**: A system developed with FastAPI and MongoDB for managing course schedules and instructor assignments, ensuring no scheduling conflicts.

## 🌱 What I’m Learning
I am continuously exploring new technologies and best practices to stay at the forefront of backend development and machine learning. Currently, I'm diving into Node.js.
